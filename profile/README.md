## *NiPreps* (NeuroImaging PREProcessing toolS)

Please visit www.nipreps.org

### About
The current neuroimaging workflow has matured into a large chain of processing and analysis steps involving a large number of experts,
across imaging modalities and applications. The development and fast adoption of *fMRIPrep* have revealed that neuroscientists need
tools that simplify their research workflow, provide visual reports and checkpoints, and engender trust in the tool itself.
The *NiPreps* framework extends *fMRIPrep*'s approach and principles to new imaging modalities.
The vision for *NiPreps* is to provide end-users (i.e., researchers) with applications that allow them to perform quality control
smoothly and to prepare their data for modeling and statistical analysis.
